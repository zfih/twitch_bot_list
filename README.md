# Twitch bot ban list

### ARCHIVED AS OF 28/09/21

I have removed the lists as chatbots have been overwhelmed with filesay commands. Also the amount of new accounts created are too high to keep up with.

Some of the chat bots have started restricting the use of filesay and in general the sentiment is to just use tools to make the bots unfollow instead of banning them, as they don't really type in chats anyway and banning them doesn't stop them from creating new ones.
Some new chat bots have functionality to do these things, so if you really want this kind of functionality I suggest looking into those instead of using StreamElements or Fossabot to spam bans.
